The website is just getting better. I am slowly but surely defining the amount of work I will spend on each section. There are many things that I can do but for now my goal is to ship my new website focused on simplicty, and visual impact. 

I do not see much value in overengineering, because: 

1. I will never ship anything. 
2. Personal projects such as this one usually take forever.
3. Understand when good is enough. 
4. Unnecessary hyper complexity will kill the fun.

The website is simple, it runs it works, it showcases visuals the best way possible. It is easy to edit and manage and I have control over my work. It's also cheaper to host.
