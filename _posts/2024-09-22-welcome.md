Yes! I finally have my own coded website and I can save myself 150 euros per year on hosting fees.

Set up with ChatGTP and Github and Jekyll I'm fullfilling a lifelong dream of havign my own website 'coded' by me, or well, built by me.

Something I always struggled when I was creating websites without any knowledge in HTML or CSS was to have headers and footers loaded. 

I was not smart enough when I was a teenager, I just liked computer games and there was too much going on to dive deep.

Now I can finally have it... just took 20 years to get back to those teenage memories.
