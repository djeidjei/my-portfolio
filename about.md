# About Me

I'm a Berlin based experienced creative director with a track record of success. I've worked with top brands including BMW, Cartier, Prada, Mercedes Benz, Porsche, Audi, Riot, Apple TV, Google, Adidas, and the Boston Celtics. My professional reach extends to consulting for artists, where I managed projects for the Emmy-winning show "Severance" on Apple TV+. I've also contributed my expertise to the startup world. Now at Journee, a metaverse company, I lead a team of several artists and producers.

The goal is simple: create stunning virtual experiences for the world's top brands. My work is defined by incredible visual quality, efficiency, and innovation.
